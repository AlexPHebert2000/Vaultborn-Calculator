# Vaultborn Calculator

## A calculator for Magic the Gathering to determine the effects of multiple copies of cards like [Vaultborn Tyrant](https://scryfall.com/card/big/20/vaultborn-tyrant) or [Terror of the Peaks](https://scryfall.com/card/otj/149/terror-of-the-peaks).

## Why make this?

I made a [commander deck](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/-5jV8M1sHEOgUoEStqnLRw) with [Ghired, Mirror of the Wilds](https://scryfall.com/card/otj/205/ghired-mirror-of-the-wilds) at the helm that looks to create tons of copies of creatures. Multiple times lots of copies of a creature that cares about other creatures entering would be made and we would spend 5+ minutes trying to calculate the effects, then the player would make another copy and chaos would again ensue. 

That is why I decided to make the [**Vaultborn Calculator**](https://main.dlwlh2umo5lt0.amplifyapp.com/) named after the biggest offender, Vaultborn Tyrant. Rather than limit the calcuator to only vaultborn tyrant, you can use it to calculate a multitude of effects and remain relevant as more and more powerful ["creaturefall"](https://tagger.scryfall.com/tags/card/creaturefall) effects are made.
